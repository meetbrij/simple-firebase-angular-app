# Firebase + Angular CRUD app

This project is a simple CRUD application created using Angular and it uses [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) cloud database to store the data.

Tools used
- node.js and npm
- gulp
- bower
- angular-seed
- [angular-fire](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/) (module)
- [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/)
- zurb foundation

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the repository and install the dependencies using the following command:
```
npm install
npm start
```

You need to signup with Firebase and create one app. In this case I created a firebase app named - breezeContactsApp. You would use the URL of this app to interact with Firebase through Angular and do the CRUD operations. (Free version would do).

The above project was created by following the steps given in the tutorial at [Eduonix](https://www.udemy.com/learn-angularjs-development/)
